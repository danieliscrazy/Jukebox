This is the start of my journal file! This project is a physical Minecraft jukebox that plays physical discs! This will be accomplished using a 3d printed model with a Pi Zero W powering it, an RC522 RFID shield, a wired speaker (maybe Bluetooth if I can't get OTG working), and RFID chips I put into the discs (hardware choices are not final). Everything will be 3D printed. I'd add more but I need to go to my next class, so I'll add more later.
