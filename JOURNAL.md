This is the start of my journal file! This project is a physical Minecraft jukebox that plays physical discs! This will be accomplished using a 3d printed model with a Pi Zero W powering it, an RC522 RFID shield, a wired speaker (maybe Bluetooth if I can't get OTG working), and RFID chips I put into the discs (hardware choices are not final). Everything will be 3D printed. I'd add more but I need to go to my next class, so I'll add more later.

Going to start doing work and research on this stuff. Time is 1:17 PM for my own future reference. I know this might be bad practice but I'm just gonna make a commit every time I edit the journal. Anyways, I think that I might instead of a Pi Zero use a 3 B+, because the Zero has no native wired output, and getting it and a HAT would be about the same cost as getting a Pi 3 B+. Gonna look at how I could do the NFC interface and code now.
